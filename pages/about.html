  <p>Hello! My name is Matthew, though I really don't care whether you call me Matthew or Matt. On the internet however, I tend to go by <code>Lunarki</code>. Though, if it's already taken, I tend to use <code>Mattdogking</code>.</p>
  <p>I'm a 10th grade High School student in the United States, currently working towards gaining a career in the realm of Computer Science. I enjoy creating little projects, including this website along with my.. perhaps best friend <a href="https://dnomaid.co.uk">Tom</a> aka <code>dnomaid</code>.</p>
  <p>One such project I would enjoy working on is using my old AMD FX 6300 BE processor and MSI NVIDIA GTX 610 LP card to create a server I can use for different little projects, such as experimenting with the <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/about">Proxmox</a> hypervisor. Along with this, it would act as a Network Access Storage server or NAS for short.</p>
  <p>Along with these projects, I have a few hobbies. These hobbies include: Photography, Music Production, Video Production, RC Helicopters, and other such things. Perhaps I'll get into them more once I have the time.</p>
  <p>I guess I should end this with why this website exists. Tom and I created this site in the hopes of using it for practice and experience in HTML and CSS (or SCSS!). Not only this, but it allows me somewhere I can host different projects and experiments, including class assignments if need be. Besides, this would look good on a college and/or university application, wouldn't it?</p>
