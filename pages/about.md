Welcome to LunarNet! I'm Matt, and this is just one of my experiments.

I'm hoping to grow this into something more, perhaps a community of some kind.

**More about me:**
So, I'm Matt. I'm a high school student in the United States leaning all about computer science and what not. I tend to run Linux, program things for fun, all of the usual stuff.

You may be interested in my [FaQ](/faq/) page. If not, feel free to explore.

Found any problems with the site? Pester [me](/contact) or [Tom](https://tomr.me/#contact) and we'll get it sorted (probably).
