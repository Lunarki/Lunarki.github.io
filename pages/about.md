Hello! I'm Matthew, and this is one of my experiments.

This site was created not only to learn HTML, CSS / SCSS, Jekyll, and other such things, but also to host different school projects of various sorts. Anyways, here's some stuff about me:

I'm a 11th grade High School student in The United States of America. I'm working on finishing my education and go into the field of Computer Science (I know, ingenius!). I enjoy such projects as this website, made with the help of my friend [Tom](https://dnomaid.co.uk) (aka `dnomaid`).

Along with these projects, I enjoy photography, music production, video production, and other such things.


You may be interested in my [FaQ](/faq/) page. If not, feel free to explore.

Found any problems with the site? Pester me or [Tom](https://tomr.me/#contact) and we'll get it sorted (probably).
