Hello! My name is Matthew, though I really don't care whether you call me Matthew or Matt. On the internet however, I tend to go by `Lunarki`. Though, if it's already taken, I tend to use `Mattdogking`.  

I'm a 10th grade High School student in the United States, currently working towards gaining a career in the realm of Computer Science. I enjoy creating little projects, including this website along with my.. perhaps best friend [Tom](https://dnomaid.co.uk) aka `dnomaid`.  

One such project I would enjoy working on is using my old AMD FX 6300 BE processor and MSI NVIDIA GTX 610 LP card to create a server I can use for different little projects, such as experimenting with the [Proxmox Hypervisor](https://www.proxmox.com/en/about). Along with this, it would act as a Network Access Storage server or NAS for short.  

Along with these projects, I have a few hobbies. These hobbies include: Photography, Music Production, Video Production, RC Helicopters, and other such things. Perhaps I'll get into them more once I have the time.

I guess I should end this with why this website exists. Tom and I created this site in the hopes of using it for practice and experience in HTML and CSS (or SCSS!). Not only this, but it allows me somewhere I can host different projects and experiments, including class assignments if need be. Besides, this would look good on a college and/or university application, wouldn't it?


You may be interested in my [FaQ](/faq/) page. If not, feel free to explore.

Found any problems with the site? Pester me or [Tom](https://tomr.me/#contact) and we'll get it sorted (probably).
