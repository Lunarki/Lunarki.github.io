Hi! I'm Matt, and LunarNet is one of my experiments.

This site was created to experiment and learn Jekyll and other fundamental web technologies. It's also used to host a few school projects.

I'm a High School student in the US and thus this website can change a lot as I experiment, so be warned.

LunarNet is expanding to become a more professional site and hopefully, at some point, a community of some kind.

You may be interested in my [FaQ](/faq/) page. If not, feel free to explore.

Found any problems with the site? Pester [me](/contact) or [Tom](https://tomr.me/#contact) and we'll get it sorted (probably).
