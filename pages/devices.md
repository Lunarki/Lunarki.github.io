Pictures are coming soon, along with updates to the devices. Eventually I might use the [DokuWiki](https://wiki.lunarnet.space) I am setting up for my device listing.

- ### lunar-base
  The Desktop is my primary system and main workstation.  
  [Specifications](/devices/desktop)

- ### MATT-LAPTOP  
  The Laptop used to be my primary system before the 9600k Desktop Upgrade. It still excels in graphical performance compared thanks to it's GTX 1050 2GB Mobile dGPU.  
  [Specifications](/devices/laptop)

- ### The Tablet   
  Rarely used, underpowered, and can barely run Windows. WiFi does not work with any variants of Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, or any other GNU/Linux Operating Systems.

This is currently a work-in-progress site, and thus changes should be expected.
