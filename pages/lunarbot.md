LunarBot is a work in progress Discord bot created as a fun project to learn JavaScript. As of such, it may break at any time and is experimental. Continue at your own risk.

LunarBot Alpha has a multitude of features, including the current public commands:
Kick
Ban
Purge
Addrole
Removerole
Invite

The current prefix is `>`, however a prefix command will eventually be added.


This page will eventually be updated with more information, such at change logs, etc..
You can add LunarBot to your server [here](/lunarbot/invite).
